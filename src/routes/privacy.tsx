      <section><h2>What Deckly stores</h2><p>Deckly keeps profile preferences, decks, questions, notes, bookmarks, quiz results, study history, XP, streaks, achievements, settings, and optional wallpaper images in your browser’s persistent storage on this device.</p></section>
      <section><h2>How information is used</h2><p>That information is used only to run Deckly on this device: restore your library after a refresh, calculate progress, and personalise the interface. Deckly does not sell personal information.</p></section>
      <section><h2>AI services</h2><p>Deckly creates prompts for you to copy into an AI service of your choice. Deckly does not send those prompts or your study materials to an AI provider on your behalf. Any service you choose has its own privacy practices.</p></section>
      <section><h2>Moving data</h2><p>Use JSON export to download a backup of your library. Import that file on another browser or machine when you want a copy there. Clearing this browser’s storage deletes the local library unless you have a backup.</p></section>
      <section><h2>Hosting</h2><p>The Deckly application files may be served from a host so you can open the app in a browser. That does not include an account or a copy of your study library.</p></section>
      <section><h2>Your choices</h2><p>You can update settings, remove study content, export a backup, or erase all locally stored data from Settings. You can also stop using Deckly and clear this site’s data in your browser.</p></section>
      <section><h2>Changes</h2><p>This policy may be updated as Deckly changes. The effective date above will be revised when material updates are made.</p></section>
